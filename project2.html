                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Despite multiple updates, the Waves Coffee app continues to face usability challenges that hinder its effectiveness in providing a seamless coffee ordering experience for its diverse customer base. The app's initial screen prioritizes loyalty points, but the absence of a clear explanation about the point system causes confusion and inconvenience for users who primarily seek to access the menu or place online orders. Additionally, the unclear "cart" icon on the home bar further exacerbates user frustration, as it fails to offer a straightforward pathway to the menu selection.</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>The context of the Waves Coffee (App) project is centred around a UX case study conducted by a participant who has undergone the UX Strategy 1 course as part of the New Media Design & Web Development program at BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology). The case study is intended to demonstrate the application of UX strategy skills acquired during the course.</p>
                    <p><b>Project Motive:</b><br/>
                        The main objective of the project is to conduct a UX case study for the Waves Coffee app, aiming to enhance the user experience and usability of the app. By applying the skills learned in the UX Strategy 1 course, the participant seeks to identify user pain points, understand the target audience, create user personas, and analyze user tasks on the app. The project is an opportunity for the participant to showcase their ability to empathize with users, identify usability issues, and propose effective solutions to improve the overall UX of the app.</p>

                    <h2>Assumption</h2>
                    <p>We assume that the confusing app design and lack of intuitive navigation are contributing to a decline in user satisfaction and usage. Users are likely to abandon the app or seek alternatives due to the difficulties encountered in performing essential tasks, such as checking the menu and placing online orders. A more user-centric and straightforward app design, focusing on primary functionalities like menu visibility and simplified ordering, can significantly improve user engagement and overall satisfaction.</p>

                    <h2>Discovery</h2>
                    <h3>Preliminary Analysis</h3>
                    <p>At this stage, I have conducted an initial assessment of the Waves Coffee app, delving into its functionality and design aesthetics to comprehensively its current state. This analysis primarily focused on the app's usability and user experience, with a particular emphasis on the mobile version of the app.</p>

                    <p>Based on the evaluation, several usability issues and pain points have been identified, which may hinder the app's effectiveness in providing a seamless coffee ordering experience. Some of the key findings include:</p>
                        
                    <p>1. Unclear Navigation: The app lacks clear guidance on how to contact customer support or find essential information related to orders, loyalty points, or store locations, making it difficult for users to seek assistance when needed.</p>
                        
                    <p>2. Limited Social Media Integration: The app does not fully integrate with social media platforms, potentially missing an opportunity to engage with users and create a sense of community around the Waves Coffee brand.</p>
                        
                    <p>3. Search Functionality Missing: The absence of a search feature within the app makes it challenging for users to quickly find specific coffee options or menu items, leading to increased scrolling and potential frustration.</p>
                        
                    <p>4. User Interface Overload: The app appears to have an excess of content or elements that may contribute to a cluttered user interface, potentially overwhelming users and causing confusion.</p>
                        
                    <p>5. Inefficient Information Retrieval: Users may face difficulty in easily accessing vital information, such as store locations, menu items, or details about the Waves Coffee loyalty program.</p>
                        
                    <p>6. Navigation and Scrolling: The app may require excessive scrolling to access various features or menus, impacting the user experience and potentially deterring users from exploring all available options.</p>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>To better understand Waves Coffee's app and its position in the market, a competitive analysis was conducted with a focus on two key competitors: Starbucks and Blenz Coffee. The analysis examined the functionality, design, and social media presence of these coffee shop apps to identify key takeaways and potential areas of improvement for Waves Coffee.</p>

                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <p>Through the competitive analysis, Waves Coffee can gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of its app in comparison to its competitors. By leveraging the key takeaways from Starbucks and Blenz Coffee, Waves Coffee can make informed design and functionality decisions to elevate its app's user experience and stay competitive in the coffee shop app market.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Target Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Although the books written by the author primarily target the age range between 4 and 18 yrs old, the majority of the users of the website are adults. An article published in 2012 by Publishers Weekly reported on a study showing that 55% of books intended for Young Adult (12 -18) audiences were bought by adults and 78% of those were for the buyer’s own reading. Based on this statistics, I determined the age range for the author’s website would be between 13 to 54 yrs.
                        <br/>I identified a list of user archetypes/ user types for the website based on demography, behaviour and motivations. User types will help with understanding the user’s needs and their pain points in using the website.</p>

                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <h3>User Persona</h3>
                    <p>Based on the previous audience analysis, I developed a persona to represent the ideal user of the Waves Coffee that would help me to better understand the users’ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">

                </div>
                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <p>Understanding the perspective of "Savvy Coffee Seeker Sarah" will assist Waves Coffee in redesigning their app to cater to her needs and motivations, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and customer satisfaction within their target demographic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <h3>Pain Point I</h3>
                    <p>The app's biggest pain point is its lack of user-friendliness and failure to prioritize essential features like checking the menu or placing online orders. The initial screen's focus on loyalty points without a clear explanation of the point system leads to confusion among users, hindering the seamless user experience they expect.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <h3>Pain Point II</h3>
                    <p>The ambiguous "cart" icon on the home bar represents another significant pain point, as it does not provide a straightforward path for users to access the menu selection. This design flaw leads to frustration and difficulty in finding the desired items for online orders.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container max800 gs_reveal">
                    <h3>Pain Point III</h3>
                    <p>Accessing the menu for online orders proves cumbersome, requiring users to click the unclear "cart" icon on the home bar and then select a branch to view the menu. This extra step adds unnecessary complexity to the ordering process, potentially deterring users from using the app for online purchases.</p>
